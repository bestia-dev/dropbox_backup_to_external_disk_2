My projects on Github are more like a tutorial than a finished product: [bestia-dev tutorials](https://github.com/bestia-dev/tutorials_rust_wasm).

## Version 2

The second version will have separated projects for [CLI](https://github.com/bestia-dev/dropbox_backup_to_external_disk_cli), [TUI](https://github.com/bestia-dev/dropbox_backup_to_external_disk_tui) and [GUI](https://github.com/bestia-dev/dropbox_backup_to_external_disk_gui) interfaces with a common [LIB](https://github.com/bestia-dev/dropbox_backup_to_external_disk_lib) project.  
This is to show how the same library can be used from different user-interfaces.  
In Cargo.toml I can use the local path to define the dependency and that way I have always the newest code available:

```toml
[dependencies]
dropbox_backup_to_external_disk_lib = { path = "../dropbox_backup_to_external_disk_lib" }
```

VSCode is so smart that for `Go to definition` it even opens the file from the library, so I can modify that. For editing it feels just like one project.  

The prototype CLI where I experimented with the Dropbox api is here: [dropbox_backup_to_external_disk_1](https://github.com/bestia-dev/dropbox_backup_to_external_disk_1).  

## Development

From inside the development container I need to have access to the external disk directory where the dropbox backup is and access to the dropbox.com.  
I wrote a new bash script `rust_dev_pod_create.sh` to create a podman pod for this project and named it "pod_with_rust_vscode_for_dropbox".

## Open-source and free as a beer

My open-source projects are free as a beer (MIT license).  
I just love programming.  
But I need also to drink. If you find my projects and tutorials helpful, please buy me a beer by donating to my [PayPal](https://paypal.me/LucianoBestia).  
You know the price of a beer in your local bar ;-)  
So I can drink a free beer for your health :-)
